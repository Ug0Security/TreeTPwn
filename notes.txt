another pre auth rce on random stuff found on shodan

"TreeT - The Kiosk Contents Management System" 

the auth is easely bypassed, they forget to die after the 302 redirection <:*)
just remplace the 302 by 200 in the response and tada..

you can then upload a php file on the profile menu instead of the profil picture.
the path of the uploaded php is in the upload response /data/library/XXXX.php
